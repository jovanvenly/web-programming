            <a href="">Once upon a time</a> there was a kind and beautiful girl, 
            whose name was Cinderella. She lived with her cruel stepmother and stepsisters 
            where she was treated as a servant and spent her days cleaning, 
            tidying and waiting on them hand and foot.
        </p>
        <p>
            One day an invitation to a royal ball arrived. 
            The Prince was looking for a bride and everyone in the kingdom was invited.
            On the day of the ball, as they were preparing to leave, Cinderella came down 
            the stairs in a dress she had made for herself. Her stepmother and stepsisters 
            were so angry to see her looking so beautiful they tore up the dress and left without her.

            “Do not cry my child, you shall go to the ball!” she said.
            Then her Fairy Godmother found six mice playing in the pumpkin patch.
            When everything was ready, Cinderella waved goodbye to her fairy godmother who said,
            “The magic will only last until midnight. You must reach home by then.”
